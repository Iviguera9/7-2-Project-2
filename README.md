Web Application Dashboard

Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable are, mainly, achieved by focusing on effective coding that meets user functionality needs. By understanding how the program is supposed to work,
develolpers have a general idea of how to act upon it  by focusing on functionality practices before shifting focus to UI components, or non-essential needs. This was crucial when developing my CRUD Python module
as I had to make sure that the module's basic functionality aspects were implemented, and fully functioning, before considering other aspects of the program overall. By doing so, I had more time to test the module
with its dashboard and database connection. Since this module is written with few to non-specific customization aspects, this CRUD module can be used for other projects with similar requirements, or it can be 
easily modified to fit its new environment.

As a computer scientist, I tend to approach problems with a user's perspective as I develop my program. Approaching problems with a user's perpective makes for an easier development cycle as you can constantly 
visualize what kind of problems could prevent the user from doing certain tasks and what specific actions the user should make. My mentality stayed consistent throughout my previous projects. The exception this
time was the multiple environments on which I had to adapt. My strategy was to take my time testing that each individual environment have successful communication with each other. This is specially important 
considering that it is likely that future projects may require multiple environment communication methods, since most complex projects do so to comply with client requests.

Computer scientists aim to facilitate problems spawned from a digital environment and creating digital landscapes that automate, and/or replaces, simplistic first-world tasks. For instance, this project could be 
replicated using real-life chart graphs and actual physical data to report, which can take too much time, resources, and effort. Having a program, such as this one, presents the same task at a fraction of the 
resources, time and effort, making it easier for Grazioso Salvare and the main reason why they reach out to solve this problem. This is why similar companies could benefit from these kinds of projects, as they
passively save time, budget, and resources, and prevent human-made errors.
